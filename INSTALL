To compile and install OpenCFU, you will need the GNU development toolbox (
i.e. autoconf, automake, make, gcc/g++). In most distribution, all these
packages are in an installable group (e.g. "build-essensial").
You also need OpenCV library and optionally, to have a GUI, Gtkmm.

Then you can do the usual :

./configure
make
make install
